        <p>The case for coffee is stronger than ever. Study after study indicates you could be getting more from your favorite morning beverage than you thought: Coffee is chock full of substances that may help guard against conditions more common in women, including Alzheimers disease and heart disease.Caffeine is the first thing that comes to mind when you think about coffee. But coffee also contains antioxidants and other active substances that may reduce internal inflammation and protect against disease.Early research linked coffee to diseases ranging from heart disease and asthma. But Hu noted that many participants in those studies also smoked, which may have led research.</p>

    <h1 id="c5"><b><center>Types</center></b></h1>
    <div id="c6">
    <p>We have all been there, standing in line at a favorite coffeeshop, sweating because we're not entirely sure of the difference between a cold brew vs. a classic iced coffee.Oh gosh, I know I have. Good news: we're covering everything from the difference of Arabica and Robusta coffee beans to all the ways to brew your favorite cup of joe. Hold on tight. We're diving deep into your morning go-to drink.</p><br>
<ul>
    <li>Arabica:</li>
    <p>Arabica is the most popular type of coffee, hands down. Depending on who you ask, many coffee enthusiasts prefer using Arabica beans due to its taste. Typically used for black coffee, Arabica beans have a sweeter, more complex flavor that you can drink straight. Funny thing is, even though it's the most popular, it doesn't have as much caffeine as Robusta.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Robusta:</li>
    <p>While Arabica is the most popular, Robusta is cheaper and stronger. Because of its bitter flavor, you'll typically see Robusta used for espresso drinks and in instant coffee mixes. If your Monday morning is lagging, reach for a cup of coffee that uses Robusta beans. Their high caffeine content will wake you right up!</p>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Black:</li>
    <p>Black coffee is as simple as it gets with ground coffee beans steeped in hot water, served warm. And if you want to sound fancy, you can call black coffee by its proper name: cafe noir. Since it isn't doctored up with milk or sugar, the quality of coffee is especially important. Treat yourself to a coffee subscription box to find your favorite style</p>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Latte:</li>
    <p>As the most popular coffee drink out there, the latte is comprised of a shot of espresso and steamed milk with just a touch of foam. It can be ordered plain or with a flavor shot of anything from vanilla to pumpkin spice. (Here's how to make a copycat Starbucks pumpkin spice latte.)</p>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Cappucino:</li>
    <p>Cappuccino is a latte made with more foam than steamed milk, often with a sprinkle of cocoa powder or cinnamon on top. Sometimes you can find variations that use cream instead of milk or ones that throw in flavor shot, as well.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Flat white:</li>
    <p>Like the latte, this drink consists of espresso and steamed milk, but the ratio of espresso to milk is higher. Baristas also fold the milk as it steams, which creates a more velvety texture. The flat white has roots in Australia and New Zealand.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Nitro cold Brew</li>
    <p>Cutting-edge coffee roasters developed this newer type of cold brew using techniques from the beer industry: It's infused with nitrogen bubbles, so it has a frothy, beer-like texture. Trendy coffee houses dispense nitro cold brew from taps, and you can buy it by the can from brands like RISE Brewing Co. and Starbucks.

    </p>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Cortado</li>
    <p>This drink, which hails from Spain, is half espresso, half steamed milk. Unlike many Italian coffee drinks, it contains little to no foam. It's typically served in a 4.5-ounce glass.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Mocha</li>
    <p>For a long time, mocha or moka referred to a type of Arabica coffee bean grown in Yemen and was used as a blanket term for coffee beans imported from Yemen's port of Al Moka — the place after which the bean was named (via Coffee Or Die). The mocha beans were famous for having a green and yellow tint compared to their brown-colored counterparts. The mocha's iconic association with chocolate also begins here, as the beans were thought to have a distinct, chocolate-like flavor, writes Coffee Or Die.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Piccolo Lattes</li>
    <p>According to Perfect Daily Grind, piccolo lattes are made from a standard shot of espresso, two-parts steamed milk that will smoothly blend into the coffee, and a tiny layer of foam on top. While a standard latte is usually 8 ounces, a piccolo latte is nearly half its size at 3 to 4 ounces. Although similar in its small size to the cortado and macchiato, the cortado has equal parts of espresso and milk with little to no foam (via Roasty Coffee), and only a tablespoon or two of milk is added to espresso to create a macchiato (via Cru Kafe). On the other hand, Piccolo latte uses one shot of espresso and twice the amount of milk, which is then topped with a thin layer of foam. As Perfect Daily Grind has it, this composition makes a piccolo latte less intense, more milky and</p>
